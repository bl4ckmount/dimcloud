## A darker theme for SoundCloud.

What if SoundCloud were dark? Ugh, you may have seen the extensions. But this one designed with a heart and a lot of ~~gloomy~~ love. Feel absolutely free to contribute to it. Also, if you found a bug or css mistake, please, go to issues.

## Installing

Go to `src` folder to checkout [readme](src/README.md).

## Changelog:

v1.1.0a:
- *Some changes,* and I have returned back to work. Or it seems I have at least.
- *Remade project architecture*.

v1.0.0a:
- ~~***I got it right!***~~ Ugh, released, maybe? Am not sure, too much work left.
