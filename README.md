## A darker theme for SoundCloud.

What if SoundCloud were dark? Ugh, you may have seen the extensions. But this one designed with a heart and a lot of ~~gloomy~~ love.

Feel absolutely free to contribute to it. Also, if you found a bug or css mistake, please, go to issues.

Is made with `sass/scss`.

## Download

It is undownloadable for a little time.

## Contribution

To build the extension you firstly need to copy `manifest.json` and `content.js` files.

```sh
$ npm run copy-manifest && npm run copy-content
```

And then run, and you will be running this often, unless you set `--watch`.

```sh
$ npm run build
```

To compile/transpile `sass/scss` into `css` right into `dist/dimcloud.css`.

## Changelog:

v1.0a:
- ~~***I got it right!***~~ Ugh, released, maybe? Am not sure, too much work left.
